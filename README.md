# ApiBackEndYayou<br/>
ongoing project linking player and esports teams => https://api.chapristi.net/api<br/>
The api was build with api paltform => https://api-platform.com/ <br/>
i was create this api to introduce me to api platform and to propose a sort of social media to every gamer can using to search or to recruit some people on a esport team. i was create this project with a friend who was had to make the front end in react/redux unfortunately he decide to do not his job and leave the porject. The principal assets are finished but i have already some ideas to improve this project over several years.
