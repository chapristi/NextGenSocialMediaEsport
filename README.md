# ApiBackEndYayou<br/>
ongoing project linking player and esports teams => https://api.chapristi.net/api<br/>
The api was build with api paltform => https://api-platform.com/ <br/>
# Why and for who? 
i was create this api to introduce me to api platform and to propose a sort of social media to every gamer can using to search or to recruit some people on a esport team. I had created a system of internal and external administrators to the application. what I mean by this is that each person who decides to create a team is an admin of it and can therefore administer everything that is there members (accept requests, recruit people, add new admins, manage messages, manage descriptions ... from his team, exclude people who do not respect the rules and much more) then when I talk about the external administration I mean the administration of the site which is able to do everything.
then there was a friendship system where a person could search for players who co-answered him and add them as friends once the request was accepted he could send private messages live thanks to pusher
there is also a live chat so that people from the same team can communicate with each other
there is also a performance search system to find the teams and players who co-responsible us for the choices made at the creation of the account.

i was create this project with a friend who was had to make the front end in react/redux unfortunately he decide to do not his job and leave the porject. The principal assets are finished but i have already some ideas to improve this project over several years.
if someone are interested to make the front with me of course just add me on discord.<br>
